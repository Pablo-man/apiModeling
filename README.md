First install dependencies, using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).
When you clone this repository, yo have to install dependecies in each of the folders, because each one is a node.js proyect
```bash
  npm install
```

After having prepared the proyect, these commands are available in `package.json`.
```bash
  npm run dev #run server on port 3000 (CLI) and port 8080 (Server)
```
